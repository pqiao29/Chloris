\usage{
plot_inout(
  input,
  type = "RDR",
  cluster_labels = NULL,
  CN_states = NULL,
  state_mean = "standard",
  lim = NULL,
  break_idx = NULL,
  cluster_colour = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Matrix of RDR or BAF, where each row is a gene and each column represents a cell.}

\item{type}{"RDR" or "BAF".}

\item{cluster_labels}{A list of one or more cell partitions, each partition is represented as
an N dimensional vector of cluster labels, N is the number of cells.
The columns in \code{input} will be ordered according to the first element in \code{cluster_labels}.
If \code{cluster_labels == NULL}, the order of columns in \code{input} will be maintained.}

\item{CN_states}{A list of K by U matrices of copy number states in K clusters with U genes.}

\item{state_mean}{Only needed if \code{!is.null(CN_states)} for adjusting state colour representation in clonal profiles.
The \code{CN_states} will be plotted together with \code{input} as one heatmap, where each state is
represented by the according value in \code{state_mean}. 
If \code{state_mean == "standard"}, state labels take the most saturated colours.  
If \code{state_mean == "input"}, state colours reflect observed RDR assigned to each state.}

\item{lim}{The imposed range of \code{input}.}

\item{break_idx}{The index of the first gene in each chromosome. This will generate a horizontal line for each index.}

\item{cluster_colour}{A vector of colours for each cluster.}
